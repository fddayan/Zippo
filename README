== Zippo

zippo is a set of Rake tasks that are going to be able light your mapreduce pipes.

zippo basically has a few methods that build Rake tasks that help you run you map reduce jobs in Java and eventually connect them together.

I wrote this for a company and they did not want to use it because they did not want to install ruby in the servers. Fare enough.

So I do not get real feedback anymore. If you are going to use it and you want something in I can code it for you.
